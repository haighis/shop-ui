# Shop UI

- View list of products with product information

- Choose quantity for each product they wish to put into the shopping cart

- Review their shopping cart to update the quantity or remove the product from cart

- Once in a cart I should be able to view the list of products and add more to their shopping cart.

- Submit order and show an order confirmation page

- When I close a browser tab or browser and then entry the commerce site I should return to the application with the last state of their shopping cart
